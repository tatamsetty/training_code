# Transactional data
    # Actions (Web based actions)
    # Form Entry
    # APP / Website
    # Events
        # Trigger
        # Time based
        # Automated Process Based

# Look Up data / Master Data
    # Plans
    # Offerings
    
    

# DB
# Flat Files
    # XMLs
    # CSVs = Comma Seperated values
    # JSONs
    
Normalized Data Model  = ERD = Entity relation Diagram    
OLTP = Online Transactional Processing Systems
DB
* OLTP has Current data

# Copy from DB
# Export to Flat Files
    # CSVs

Normalized Data Model  = ERD = Entity relation Diagram    
ODS = Operational data store
DB
* OLTP has Current data + Historical 
* Intermediate DB

# Copy from DB
# Export to Flat Files
    # CSVs

De-Normalized Data Model  = ERD = Entity relation Diagram    
OLAP = Online Analytical Processing Systems = DataWarehouse (Star Schema /Snowflake Schema)
DB
* OLAP has **De-Normalized** Current data + Historical data

Ideal for
Build Analytics / Business Intell'nce tools on this DB
SQLs = Select statements

ETL = Extract (From OLTP) || Transform (Convert Normalized data to De-Normalized) || Load(Load into OLAP)
* Batch Process (Time interval)
    - Load every hour
    - Every day
* Realtime
